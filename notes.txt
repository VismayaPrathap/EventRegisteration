 Steps:
 1. Create a virtual environment using-> python3 -m venv foldername
 2. To activate virtual environment in Windows -> .\foldername\Scripts\activate
 3. Packages in Django -> pip install django
 4. To start a project -> django-admin startproject EventRegProject
 5. To create application -> python manage.py startapp eventapp
 6. In settings.py, go to INSTALLED_APPS, and there add the app like this: 'eventapp', at the end.
 7. In urls.py, add:
 urlpatterns=[
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('',include('eventapp.urls')),
 ]
 
 NOW GO TO EVENTAPP FOLDER, and WITHIN IT:
 8. create a urls.py file that contains:
 from django.urls import path
 from . import views
 urlpatterns=[
    path('',views.index, name='index')
 ]

 9. in views.py (also in eventapp):
 from django.shortcuts import render
 from django.http import HttpResponse

 def index(request):
    return HttpResponse("Hai, you've arrived at index")

command to run is: python manage.py runserver

10. In the eventapp folder, create a templates folder
 then within this template folder, create a 'eventapp' folder.

11. put the two html files(index, details) in this folder.
After this, make changes in the views.py file:
    return render(request,'eventapp/index.html')
12. {% load static %} -> jinja format(?) right after the doctype! line in index.html
13. create a 'static' folder, and put the the images and css and js files into it.
